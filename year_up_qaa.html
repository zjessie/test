Year Up Program
	</h1>
<p>
Year Up has two phases.The L and D (learning and developmnet)
and the Internship phase.

<h2>
L and D
</h2>
<p>
Learning and development is made up of three Mods. 
Mods 1, 2, and 3. Mods 1 and 2 focus on software programing and hardware(what makes technology run), while mod three focuses on your track. A track is a career the student would like to follow. The L and D phase is six months(same as the internship phase, henceforth "Year Up"). The Different tracks a student can follow are:
<ol>
<li>
Quality Assurance

IT Support

</ol>

<p>
The internship phase is where the students can shine! Not only do they show off their new found skills, but they grow professionally. Internship is like having the career itself, its usually 9-5.
